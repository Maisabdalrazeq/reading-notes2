**How to change image size in CSS?**

*Sometimes, it is required to fit an image into a certain given dimension. We can resize the image by specifying the width and height of an image. A common solution is to use the max-width: 100%; and height: auto; so that large images do not exceed the width of their container. The max-width and max-height properties of CSS works better, but they are not supported in many browsers.*

*Another way of resizing the image is by using the object-fit property, which fits the image. This CSS property specifies how a video or an image is resized to fit its content box. It defines how an element fits into the container with an established width and height.*

*The object-fit property is generally applied to image or video. This property defines how an element responds to the width and height of its container. Mainly there are five values of object-fit property such as fill, contain, cover, none, scale-down, initial, and inherit. The default value of this property is "fill".*


**How You Can Control of Width and Height Of An Image In Css?**

*The width property specifies the width of an element, and the height property specifies the height of an element.*

*The width and height of the image can be specified by applying these properties to the IMG element.*

***Examples:***

`div {  `
`width: auto;`  
`text-align: center;`  
`padding: 15px;  `
`border: 3px solid red;`  
`}  `
`img {`  
`max-width: 100%;`  
`height: auto;  `
`} `

**Output**

*SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility for relevant searches. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.*


**How does SEO work?**

*You might think of a search engine as a website you visit to type (or speak) a question into a box and Google, Yahoo!, Bing, or whatever search engine you're using magically replies with a long list of links to webpages that could potentially answer your question.*

*That's true. But have you ever stopped to consider what's behind those magical lists of links?*

*Here's how it works: Google (or any search engine you're using) has a crawler that goes out and gathers information about all the content they can find on the Internet. The crawlers bring all those 1s and 0s back to the search engine to build an index. That index is then fed through an algorithm that tries to match all that data with your query.*


***There are a lot of factors that go into a search engine's algorithm, and here's how a group of experts ranked their importance:***
