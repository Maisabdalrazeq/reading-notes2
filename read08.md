**Before you start designing your page using CSS, you must design framework ..

**How do CSS frameworks work?**

*CSS framework gives web developers a basic structure, which includes grid, interactive UI patterns, web typography, tooltips, buttons, form elements, icons. This structure helps web developers to start quickly and efficiently when they are designing a website or web applications.*

**What is the Layout In Css?**

*CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.*

***Some Layout methods:***

1. Normal flow.

*Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that.*


2. Floats.

*Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called “text wrap”.*

**How you can clearing the float?**

*Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float.* 

3. Positioning.

*Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal document layout flow, and make them behave differently, for example sitting on top of one another, or always remaining in the same place inside the browser viewport.*
